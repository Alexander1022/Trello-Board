## Trello is a web-based, Kanban-style, list-making application and is developed by Trello Enterprise, a subsidiary of Atlassian. Created in 2011 by Fog Creek Software (now Glitch), it was spun out to form the basis of a separate company in New York City in 2014 and sold to Atlassian in January 2017.
